* Looking inside 'cat /etc/passwd':
We still need to deconstruct the problem and explain the solution for...
	```
	cat /etc/passwd | sed -e 's/#.*//' -e 's/[ ^I]*$//' -e '/^$/ d' -e 's/:.*//g' \
	| tr '\n' ',' | rev | tr "," "\n" | sort -r | tr "\n" ","  \
	| sed -e 's/, */, /g' -e 's/.$//' -e 's/.\{3\}$//'
	```

>> This answer is still missing the ending with a dot (.

the curriculum says need bash file. 
so, 
```#!/bin/sh
cat /etc/passwd | sed -e 's/#.*//' -e 's/[ ^I]*$//' -e '/^$/ d' -e 's/:.*//g' \
                                  | tr '\n' ',' | rev | tr "," "\n" | sort -r | tr "\n" ","  \
                                  | sed -e 's/, */, /g' -e 's/.$//' -e 's/.\{3\}$//'
echo ".")```

i think it's better. by tkgshn
